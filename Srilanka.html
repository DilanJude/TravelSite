    <h2 align="center"><u>Geography of Sri Lanka</u></h2><br>
    <img src="images/section1.jpg" height="817" width="1000" align="center">
    <ul>
    <li><p>Sri Lanka lies on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formerly part of the Indo-Australian Plate.
    which is located in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal, between the latitudes of 5° and 10° North,& the longitudes 79° and 82° East.
    Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland of the Indian subcontinent by the Manna Gulf & Palk Strait. 
    According to the Hindu mythology, a bridge used to exist between the India & Sri Lanka.
    The only sources to the validity of that is upto only a chain of limestone pieces remaining above the sea level.
    History claims that it was available to use on foot up to 1480 AD, until cyclones deepened the channel & brought it to the current level.
    Portions are still as shallow as 1 metre,almost hindering the navigation path. 
    The island consists mostly of flat to coastal plains, with mountains rising in the south-central part. 
    The highest point in the Island is Pidurutalagala, reaching 2524 meters above the sea level.</p></li>
   <li> <p>Sri Lanka has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the Mahaweli River, extending 335 kilometres (208 mi).
      These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 metres (33 ft) or more. The highest is
      Bambarakanda Falls, with a height of 263 metres (863 ft).
      Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585 km (985 mi) long. Sri Lanka claims an Exclusive Economic Zone  extending 200 nautical miles,
      which is approximately 6.7 times Sri Lanka's land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support
      highly productive marine ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses.
      Sri Lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons.
      Sri Lanka's mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares and played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian 
      Ocean tsunami.The island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite, feldspar, graphite, silica, kaolin, mica and thorium.
      Existence of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway.</p></li>

    our Island is one of 25 top biodiversities in the world.
     Though we are a small island, we have thehighest biodiversity density in the continent of Asia.
    A remarkably high amount of species among its fauna & flora, 27 percent of the 3,210 flowering plants &
    22% of the mammals in our country are endemic.Sri Lanka has a number of 24 wildlife reserves declared,
    which are the homes to a great no. of native species such as the Asian Elephant, Leopard, a variety of deer, the purple-faced langur, & endangered wild boars 
    including also porcupines & pangolins.
    Flowering acacias flourish in Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of dry-land forests are valuable species such as Satinwood,
    Ebony, Ironwood & Teak. The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with many trees, 
    & a dense amount of vines & creepers.
    Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes/locations of the Island.</li></p>
    <p><li>
      Yala National Park in the southeast harbours herds of Elephants,Deers,Tigers & Peacocks. 
      The Wilpattu National Park which is located in the northwest of the country,is the largest national park,
      preserves the habitats of many water birds such as Pelicans & Spoonbills,etc.
